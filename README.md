## Features

### Run Retros Remotely
Postfacto lets you run an agile retrospective even when your team is distributed across the world. Your retros will live update across all your devices so each participant can follow along on their device.

### Easy Onboarding
Easily [set up](deployment/README.md#allowing-users-to-create-retros) Postfacto to work with Google OAuth so users can sign up with their Google accounts. Alternatively, you can control access to your instance with the admin dashboard.

### Run Public or Private Retros
You can create private retro boards for your team that are password protected or choose to leave them public so that anyone you give the link to can access them.

### Mobile Friendly
Participants can add and vote on items from their mobile devices, so it is easy to run a retro without everyone in the group having a laptop nearby. This works well for retros where some people are in the room and some are remote.

### Record Action Items
Retros are designed to help teams improve and that's hard to do without taking action. Postfacto tracks your team's actions to help you keep on top of them.
